2010-09-15: txosc Release 0.2.0

    This release of txosc is the first in the 0.2 stable branch. Its features and API will not change throughout the 0.2 series.

    Bugs fixed:
    * #12: Translate host names into IP addresses.
    * #27: removeAllCallbacks() set _childNodes as empty list, not dict.
    * #25: The blocking senders now packs messages with empty bytes.

2010-08-17: Release 0.1.6

    This release provides an synchronous implementation that allows developers to use txosc in applications that do not use Twisted, just blocking socket network programming in Python. It also provides two new types of arguments: ColorArgument and MidiArgument.
    
    * sync: Added support for non-Twisted sending in txosc/sync.py
    * sync: Added the sync_tcp_sender example.
    * sync: Fixed the synchronous sender binary format. 
    * sync: Catching socket errors in sync_tcp_sender 
    * osc-send: Implemented sending using blocking socket.
    * osc-send: Now uses the blocking implementation by default.
    * osc: Improved doc for ColorArgument
    * osc: Improved doc for MidiArgument

2010-07-19: Release 0.1.5

    * Implemented the MidiArgument class
    * Implemented the ColorArgument class
    * osc-send: validating arguments and returning 1 in case of error
    * osc-send: now requires a path

2010-06-30: Release 0.1.4

    * Added the osc-send script, which support UDP and TCP
    * Added the osc-receive script, which support UDP, TCP and multicast UDP
    * Removed the "beta" classifier in setup.py
    * Created man pages for osc-send and osc-receive
    * Implemented OSC URL parsing in osc-send
    * Added txosc.osc.Argument._check_type, which does the type checking at instanciation time

2010-06-28: Release 0.1.3

    * Added the txosc.osc.Message.getValues method
    * Added the txosc.osc.getAddressParts function
    * Added  __float__ and __int__ cast operators to some subclasses of txosc.osc.Argument

2010-06-08: Release 0.1.0

    * First official release
    * This is the birth of the txosc library!

2010-06-07: Stripped into txosc by Alexandre Quessy
