   module is available (#2763)
 - An obscure deadlock involving waking up the reactor within signal handlers
   in particular threads was fixed (#1997)
 - The passivePortRange attribute of FTPFactory is now honored (#3593)
 - TestCase.flushWarnings now flushes warnings even if they were produced by a
   file that was renamed since it was byte compiled (#3598)
 - Some internal file descriptors are now marked as close-on-exec, so these will

 - twisted.python.zipstream now correctly extracts the first file in a directory
   as a file, and not an empty directory (#3625)
 - proxyForInterface now returns classes which correctly *implement* interfaces
   rather than *providing* them (#3646)
 - SIP Via header parameters should now be correctly generated (#2194)
 - The Deferred returned by stopListening would sometimes previously never fire
   if an exception was raised by the underlying file descriptor's connectionLost
   method. Now the Deferred will fire with a failure (#3654)
 - The command-line tool "manhole" should now work with newer versions of pygtk

   level of children, instead of only on grandchildren. This allows for better
   symlink cycle detection (#3911)
 - Attempting to write unicode data to process pipes on Windows will no longer
   result in arbitrarily encoded messages being written to the pipe, but instead
   will immediately raise an error (#3930)
 - The various twisted command line utilities will no longer print

Twisted Conch 9.0.0 (2009-11-24)
================================

Fixes

===============================

Features
--------
 - Python source listings now include line numbers (#3486)

   fixes some Lore bugs such as throwing away certain whitespace
   (#3560, #414, #3619)
 - Lore's "lint" command should no longer break on documents with links in them
   (#4051, #4115)

Fixes
-----
 - Parse UNSEEN response data and include it in the result of
   IMAP4Client.examine (#3550)
 - The IMAP4 client now delivers more unsolicited server responses to callbacks
   rather than ignoring them, and also won't ignore solicited responses that

 - Several bugs in the SMTP client's idle timeout support were fixed (#3641,
   #1219)
 - A case where the SMTP client could skip some recipients when retrying

 - Errors during certain data transfers will no longer be swallowed. They will
   now bubble up to the higher-level API (such as the sendmail function) (#3642)
 - Escape sequences inside quoted strings in IMAP4 should now be parsed
   correctly by the IMAP4 server protocol (#3659)
 - The "imap4-utf-7" codec that is registered by twisted.mail.imap4 had a number
   of fixes that allow it to work better with the Python codecs system, and to
   actually work (#3663)
 - The Maildir implementation now ensures time-based ordering of filenames so
   that the lexical sorting of messages matches the order in which they were
   received (#3812)
 - SASL PLAIN credentials generated by the IMAP4 protocol implementations
   (client and server) should now be RFC-compliant (#3939)
 - Searching for a set of sequences using the IMAP4 "SEARCH" command should 
   now work on the IMAP4 server protocol implementation. This at least improves
   support for the Pine mail client (#1977)

   users to specify the environment in which a process will be run (#3691)

Other
-----
 - #3540

 - The HTTP auth support in the web server now allows anonymous sessions by
   logging in with ANONYMOUS credentials when no Authorization header is
   provided in a request (#3924, #3936)
 - HTTPClientFactory now accepts a parameter to enable a common deviation from
   the HTTP 1.1 standard by responding to redirects in a POSTed request with a

   encoded directory separators) will now result in a 404 instead of a 500
   (#3549, #3469)
 - When specifying a followRedirect argument to the getPage function, the state
   of redirect-following for other getPage calls should now be unaffected.  It

   getPage calls (#3192)
 - Downloading an URL of the form "http://example.com:/" will now work,
   ignoring the extraneous colon (#2402)

   microdom's methods in general should now issue more meaningful exceptions
   when invalid parameters are passed (#3421)
 - WSGI applications will no longer have spurious Content-Type headers added to
   their responses by the twisted.web server. In addition, WSGI applications
   will no longer be able to specify the server-restricted headers Server and

   of returning a 500 error (#3601)
 - Certain request-bound memory and file resources are cleaned up slightly
   sooner by the request when the connection is lost (#1621, #3176)
 - xmlrpclib.DateTime objects should now correctly round-trip over twisted.web's
   XMLRPC support in all supported versions of Python, and errors during error
   serialization will no longer hang a twisted.web XMLRPC response (#2446)
 - request.content should now always be seeked to the beginning when
   request.process is called, so application code should never need to seek 
   back manually (#3585)
 - Fetching a child of static.File with a double-slash in the URL (such as
   "example//foo.html") should now return a 404 instead of a traceback and
   500 error (#3631)
 - downloadPage will now fire a Failure on its returned Deferred instead of
   indicating success when the connection is prematurely lost (#3645)
 - static.File will now provide a 404 instead of a 500 error when it was
   constructed with a non-existent file (#3634)

 - The HTTP Auth support resource wrapper should no longer corrupt requests and
   cause them to skip a segment in the request path (#3679)
 - The twisted.web WSGI support should now include leading slashes in PATH_INFO,
   and SCRIPT_NAME will be empty if the application is at the root of the
   resource tree. This means that WSGI applications should no longer generate
   URLs with double-slashes in them even if they naively concatenate the values
   (#3721)
 - WSGI applications should now receive the requesting client's IP in the
   REMOTE_ADDR environment variable (#3730)

   refactoring of twisted.web's header support (#3697)
 - static.File now supports multiple ranges specified in the Range header
   (#3574)
 - static.File should now generate a correct Content-Length value when the
   requested Range value doesn't fit entirely within the file's contents (#3814)
 - Attempting to call request.finish() after the connection has been lost will
   now immediately raise a RuntimeError (#4013)
 - An HTTP-auth resource should now be able to directly render the wrapped
   avatar, whereas before it would only allow retrieval of child resources
   (#4014)
 - twisted.web's wsgi support should no longer attempt to call request.finish
   twice, which would cause errors in certain cases (#4025)
 - WSGI applications should now be able to handle requests with large bodies
   (#4029)
 - Exceptions raised from WSGI applications should now more reliably be turned
   into 500 errors on the HTTP level (#4019)
 - DeferredResource now correctly passes through exceptions raised from the
   wrapped resource, instead of turning them all into 500 errors (#3932)
 - Agent.request now generates a Host header when no headers are passed at
   (#4131)

-------------------------
 - The unmaintained and untested twisted.web.monitor module was removed (#2763)
 - The twisted.web.woven package has been removed (#1522)

   various things have been deprecated (#3457)
   - the loopFactory attribute is now ignored
   - the checkExpired method now does nothing
   - the lifetime parameter to startCheckingExpiration is now ignored

   CTCP ACTION messages with less confusing behavior (#3910)
 - The XMPP client protocol implementation now supports ANONYMOUS SASL
   authentication (#4067)
 - The IRC client protocol implementation now has better support for the
   ISUPPORT server->client message, storing the data in a new
   ServerSupportedFeatures object accessible via IRCClient.supported (#3285)

Fixes
-----
 - The twisted.words IRC server now always sends an MOTD, which at least makes
   Pidgin able to successfully connect to a twisted.words IRC server (#2385)
 - The IRC client will now dispatch "RPL MOTD" messages received before a
   "RPL MOTD START" instead of raising an exception (#3676)

   attribute directly; instead, that attribute will be updated when the server
   acknowledges the change (#3377)
 - The IRC client protocol implementation now supports falling back to another
   nickname when a nick change request fails (#3377, #4010)

Deprecations and Removals
-------------------------
 - The TOC protocol implementation is now deprecated, since the protocol itself
   has been deprecated and obselete for quite a long time (#3580)
 - The gui "im" application has been removed, since it relied on GTK1, which is
   hard to find these days (#3699, #3340)

Other
-----
