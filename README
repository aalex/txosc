txosc : Open Sound Control (OSC) protocol for Twisted
=====================================================
  
  Open Sound Control (OSC) is an open, transport-independent, 
  message-based protocol developed for communication among computers, 
  sound synthesizers, and other multimedia devices. 
  
  This library implements OSC version 1.1 over both UDP and TCP for 
  the Twisted Python framework. 
  
  Twisted is an event-based framework for internet applications 
  which works on Python 2.3 through 2.6.  

  Note that this library does not support messages without OSC type tags.
  This library also implement a synchronous sender that doesn't require the 
  whole Twisted framework. It should be easy to create OSC receivers with any 
  Python network tools from this library.
